# Attack Monitoring with Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM)
The purpose of this lab is to utilize Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM) in order to keep track of unsuccessful RDP login attempts made by attackers from around the world on a Windows 10 virtual machine (VM) that has been exposed and set up in Microsoft Azure.

## Summary
- Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM) was used to monitor failed RDP login attempts from global attackers on an exposed Windows 10 VM configured in Microsoft Azure.
- A custom log file (`failed_rdp.log`) was generated using a PowerShell script that extracts failed login events from Event Viewer Security Log and forwards them to a third-party API to get geolocation data.
- A custom table (`FAILED_RDP_WITH_GEO_CL`) was created in Log Analytics Workspace on Microsoft Azure using the generated log file (`failed_rdp.log`), and the table was queried to extract custom fields from RawData using Kusto Query Language (KQL).
- A workbook was created in Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM) using KQL to query data from the `FAILED_RDP_WITH_GEO_CL` table to display global attackers (RDP login failure) on the world map according to physical location and magnitude (attack count).

## Procedure
The procedures to build this lab can be found [here](https://github.com/robsann/AzureSentinelSIEMAttackMap/blob/main/procedure.md), and it was adapted from [Josh Madakor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoZeVbbZ0o0&t=1544s&ab_channel=JoshMadakor-Tech%2CEducation%2CCareer).

# Highlighs
## 1 - The Virtual Machine on Microsoft Azure
### 1.1 - The Windows 10 VM on Microsoft Azure
Here is the information about the Windows 10 virtual machine that has been created and named "honeypot-vm". This includes property details such as the computer name, operating system, public and private IP addresses, as well as the hardware being used. Furthermore, the virtual machine can be accessed via RDP.

### 1.2 - The Windows Defender Firewall Disabled
The Windows Defender Firewall of the Windows 10 virtual machine was turned off for the Domain, Private, and Public profiles.

## 2 - The PowerShell Script

### 2.1 - The PowerShell Script Main Sections

#### XML Filter
The PowerShell script uses it to filter events with ID = 4625 on Event Viewer.

#### Event Viewer Log Gathering
This section of the code retrieves events from the Windows Event Viewer based on the XML filter.

#### API Data Gathering
Use the IP address extracted from Event Viewer to make web requests to the geolocation API.

### 2.2 - The PowerShell Script Extracting Failed Login Attempts
The PowerShell ISE, with the PowerShell script created to extract failed login attempts from Event Viewer running and outputting to the terminal the detected failed login attempts.

### 2.3 - The Custom Log File Generated by the PowerShell Script
This text file is the custom log file (`failed_rdp.log`) generated by the PowerShell script. It has information about the failed RDP login attempt like the username attempted and the source IP address, and also geolocation data from the IP address. It is the file that is ingested by Log Analytics Workspace on Microsoft Azure.

## 3 - Log Analytics Workspace Custom Table on Microsoft Azure
The `failed_rdp.log` was imported in real-time from the VM, and its content was stored in the `RawData` field on the `FAILED_RDP_WITH_GEO_CL` table. A KQL query was used to extract the data in the `RawData` field and create new fields on the `FAILED_RDP_WITH_GEO_CL` table named according to the extracted data.

## 4 - Microsoft Sentinal Map on Microsoft Azure
The visualization of failed RDP login attempts on a world map was created on Microsoft Sentinel. The attackers' latitude, longitude, country, and IP address were obtained from the `FAILED_RDP_WITH_GEO_CL` table using a KQL query.

### 4.1 - After 1 Hour of Exposure.
During the first hour, two failed RDP login attempts were registered from me and three from the United Kingdom.

### 4.2 - After 24 Hours of Exposure
After 24 hours of exposure, the virtual machine had 844 failed RDP login attempts from India, 447 from Palestine, 338 from Japan, and 533 from other countries.

### 4.3 - After 48 Hours of Exposure
Over a 48-hour period, there were a significant number of failed RDP login attempts on the virtual machine, originating from various countries. There were 1.75k failed attempts from Netherlands, 1.05 from Pakistan, 844 from India, and 3.09k from other countries.

### 4.4 - Top 10 Usernames Used by Attackers
This bar plot displays the top 10 usernames most frequently used by attackers, obtained from the `FAILED_RDP_WITH_GEO_CL` table through a KQL query. The most commonly used username is `ADMINISTRATOR`, followed by `ADMIN`, `administrator`, `Administrator`, and `admin`.
